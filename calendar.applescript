Create OmniFocus Tasks for iCal events
v1.0
Dov Frankel, 2013
http://dovfrankel.com
Gets the day's list of calendar events for particular calendars and creates OmniFocus to-do items for each.
It ignores all-day events, except for those on the Library Loans calendar (populated by Delicious Library) and the Birthdays calendar, which it handles specially, gathering contact information for the birthday boy/girl, and placing it into the notes field.
You can specify which of your calendars you would like it to use by setting the property "theCalendarNames" below.
This script is best used as a Calendar item from Automator.
